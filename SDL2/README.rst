The libAngel software didn't work very well.  It was complicated and written
in C++ which meant it was not easy to integrate with Python.  So lets try
a new approach SDL2 :-)

I have downloaded and build SDL2 the unix way plus PySDL2 binding.  Lets 
see if we can turn the screen red.  

THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL code please don't use.
