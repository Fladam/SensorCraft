README
******

Most people are familiar with Minecraft (Minecraft is developed by Mojang and
not related to this programming tutorial nor do they endorse this tutorial) for
this project we are using a Minecraft type environment created in the Python
programming language. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors
Directorate  located in Dayton, Ohio created this guide to inspire kids of all
ages to learn to program and at the same time get an idea of what it is like to
be a Scientist or Engineer for the Air Force.
